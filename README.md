example of using background-clip inspired by iphone xr page

# Motivation
When I saw the texture brush effect on the iphone xr page, I was super excited to see the underlying css after just completing an internship where css was the main focus. So after some inspection, it turned out Apple was using `background-clip` to achieve this. Now this is cutting edge stuff, [`background-clip`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-clip) is only a drafted spec right now, so we need to use browser specific css `-webkit*`.
